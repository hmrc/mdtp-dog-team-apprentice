Dice-rolling simulator
====================

**Technology:** Any

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Relevant concepts**: Randomness

**Prerequisites**: Codecademy Python course sections 1-4

Goal
----
Produce a script or program which generates a random number and displays it to the user

The script should:
* Generate a random number in the range 1-6
* Show the number to the user
* Ask the user if they want to generate another number

Stretch goal
------------

* Add a second die, and display both results to the user

Possible approach
---------------
This program can be implemented fully using the terminal and python, but a javascript solution could be implemented in the browser, using a simple user interface (perhaps a button and area for the program to provide text feedback).
