Apprentice Learning Resources & Pathway
===================

This repository collects resources (both from within and beyond HMRC) for new apprentices joining the tax platform in devops roles.

What's inside
-------------
There are five kinds of content in here.

### Projects
These are longer-term extended exercises with theoretical and practical parts, intended to teach a range of technical principles, skills and tools.

### Tasks
These are shorter-term practical exercises intended to reinforce learning of a few technical concepts. These are language agnostic unless specified.

### Our context
These sessions introduce an element of the history and context of the tax platform, HMRC and working in government, rather than teaching a particular skill. This includes ways of working, what teams do, etc.

### Resources
A mixture of online tutorials and signposts to relevant external training opportunities (eg. GDS community organised training), not associated with any particular task or project.

### Bookmarks
It's tough to remember URLs. Help out new joiners with a pre-prepared list of bookmarks.

Sprint structure
---------------

*team-apprentice* will be organised around two-week agile sprints.

Each sprint will contain a mixture of technical project work (delivered via 20% supervised workshops, 80% unsupervised pair/individual working), shadowing and research.

One large project will take up nearly half of apprentices' time per sprint, and will last for at least three sprints. Medium tasks will last two sprints or less, and small tasks will last less than one sprint.
