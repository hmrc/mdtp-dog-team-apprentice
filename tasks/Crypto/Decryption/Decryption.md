Decryption
====================

**Technology:** Any

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Duration**: 4-8 hours

**Relevant concepts**: freq analysis

**Prerequisites** N/A

Goal
----
To decrypt the cipher text and identify the source text. You should produce two scripts: one to do the freq analysis, one to decrypt the file.

You should:
* Import the cipher text into your script
* Perform a frequency analysis of each letter character in the text
* Print a histogram of the freq analysis
* Write a new script that imports the freq analysis of the cipher text and a freq analysis of English (you will have to find or make this)
* Write a function to swap letter characters of the cipher text with ordinary letter frequency
* Display the decrypted text on screen

Stretch goals
------------

* Add a user interface for inputting new cipher texts
* Add a review interface for fixing up errors in your decryption (e.g. to substitute letters that have been mixed up)

Possible approach
---------------
No help with this one.
