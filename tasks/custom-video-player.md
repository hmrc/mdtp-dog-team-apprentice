**THIS EXERCISE RELIES ON ASSETS FROM DAY 11 OF [JAVASCRIPT30](https://javascript30.com/)**

**Technology:** HTML/CSS, Javascript

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Duration**: 3-4 hours

**Relevant concepts**: HTML5, DOM, event listeners, web video

**Prerequisites**: Codecademy JS course

Goal
----
Produce a custom, fully styled HTML5 video player in the browser

The project should:
* Hide the default browser video player controls
* Implement custom, fully styled, interactive video player controls

Stretch goal
-----------

* Have the player support a looped playlist of videos, and allow the user to skip forward or back through the playlist.

Possible approach
---------------
This project should be attempted in the browser.

It is sensible to start by creating a simple HTML document with a video element.

Once the basic video player has been created and is working, hide the controls, and then implement custom controls one by one.

You may decide to include:
* Play/pause
* Volume
* Seek/position
* Playback speed
