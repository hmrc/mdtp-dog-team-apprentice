Apprentice Learning Resources & Pathway
===================

This repository collects resources (both from within and beyond HMRC) for new apprentices joining the tax platform in devops roles.

What's inside
-------------
There are five kinds of content in here.

### Projects
These are longer-term extended exercises with theoretical and practical parts, intended to teach a range of technical principles, skills and tools.

### Tasks
These are shorter-term practical exercises intended to reinforce learning of a few technical concepts. These are language agnostic unless specified.

### Our context
These sessions introduce an element of the history and context of the tax platform, HMRC and working in government, rather than teaching a particular skill. This includes ways of working, what teams do, etc.

### Resources
A mixture of online tutorials and signposts to relevant external training opportunities (eg. GDS community organised training), not associated with any particular task or project.

### Bookmarks
It's tough to remember URLs. Help out new joiners with a pre-prepared list of bookmarks.
