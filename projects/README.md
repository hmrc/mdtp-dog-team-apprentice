About these projects
===================

This folder contains the syllabus for each large, multi-sprint project that *team-apprentice* will attempt. Each of these projects will consist of 80% paired or individual working, and 20% structured workshops led by a mentor.

Each project is divided into modules, which teach particular technical concepts and principles, plus associated practical work.
