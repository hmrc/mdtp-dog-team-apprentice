Dalek Voice Modulator
=======

**Technology:** Javascript

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Duration**: 1 day

**Relevant concepts**: Event listeners, web audio API

**Prerequisites**: Codecademy JS course, drumkit exercise

Goal
----
Produce a 'voice modulator' that applies the famous dalek voice effect to a sound file, then plays the result.

The project should:
* Let the user choose when to play the file
* Work with any supplied audio file

Stretch goal
------------
* Let the user record a file to be modulated, using their microphone
* Let the user adjust the modulation with a virtual control knob or dial
* Allow the modulation to occur in real time, as the user speaks

Possible approach
---------------

The tool used to achieve the famous dalek voice effect is known as a **ring modulator**.

In this exercise, you will need to recreate the circuits of a ring modulator mathematically, using javascript.

First, work out how to access and play an audio file using the web audio API.

Then, create a very simple interface with HTML/CSS.

Last, work out how to modulate the audio file to achieve the effect.

This project has been done by BBC R&D [here](http://webaudio.prototyping.bbc.co.uk/ring-modulator/). Their code uses a JS class, which you don't necessarily need, so don't just copy it wholesale.

There are also [several libraries that might help](https://alemangui.github.io/pizzicato/).
