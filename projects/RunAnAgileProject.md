### 2. Managing and Agile Project (Weeks 2-3)
Apprentices will recieve a crash course in manging an agile project. They will also need to identify a prospective project.
The crash course covers:

* Scrum master skills around retrospective planning

### 3. Project Planning (Weeks 4-5)
The third module offers the Apprentices the chance to get hands on with their projects.
They will need to:
* Decribe their project and their product vision to their dev team
* Run a brainstorming workshop with their dev team to identify areas of uncertainty
* Develop a prioritised product backlog for their product
* Plan three different retro scenarios 

### 4. Your week as a Product Owner/Delivery Lead (Weeks 6-9)
Each apprentice will put their project into development. They will spend half a sprint (one week) managing and running the team. The other three apprentices will be the dev team.
The PO/DL will be responsible for:
* Running a sprint planning meeting
* Running daily standup
* Resolving blockers
* Protecting the team's time
* Running the retro at the end of the week
* Explaning the value of the product to stakeholders

### 5. Group Retro (Week 10)
At the end of two sprints worth of projects, we will hold a group retro. This is an opportunity for apprentices to reflect on how they found life outside the dev team.
