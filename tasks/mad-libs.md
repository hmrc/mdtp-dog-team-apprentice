Mad libs story generator
=======================

**Technology:** Any

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Relevant concepts**: Functions, handling user input, loops, string concatenation

**Prerequisites**: Codecademy Python course sections 1-4

Goal
----
Create a story generator that prompts the user for input, inserts them into a premade template, and shows the finished story to the user.

The script should:
* Prompt the user for at least three pieces of input (eg. a verb, a person's name, a place, an activity)
* The program should validate the user's input (did they type something? was it a word?)
* The program should insert the input into a story template, then show it to the user

Stretch goal
------------

* Include multiple story templates, and either ask the user which they would like to use, or pick randomly.
* Dump the finished story to a text (*.txt*) file, saving it for posterity.


Possible approach
---------------

This project is a good fit for python, fully implemented in the terminal.

The most difficult part of this project is normally working out how to validate the user's input - making the program work despite user misbehaviour.
