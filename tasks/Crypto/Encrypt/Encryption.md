Encryption
====================

**Technology:** Any

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Duration**: 4-6 hours

**Relevant concepts**: freq analysis

**Prerequisites** Decryption

Goal
----
After building a tool to decrypt ciphertext, you need to build a tool to encrypt new messages.

You should:
* Import a freq analysis of English (you will have to find or make this)
* Define your cipher (on a freq basis)
* Write a function to swap ordinary letters with your cipher
* Display the encrypted text on screen

Stretch goals
------------

* Add a user interface for inputting new cipher texts
* Add an interface for specifying the cipher

Possible approach
---------------
No help with this one.
