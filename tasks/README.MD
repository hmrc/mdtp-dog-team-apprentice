When attempting these exercises, remind yourself that:

* **There is no one way to do an exercise** - Different developers will have different opinions about the best way to accomplish an exercise. This is normal. Try to strive for the simplest, most elegant, solution which works.
* **You may need to do extra research** - These exercises may introduce new concepts and principles. This will generally require you to do extra research to understand. This is normal. Refer to the documentation of the language, library or module you are using.
* **It's better to work in pairs** - It's easier to tackle these problems if you can discuss it out loud with someone else.
* **Ask for help** - Use your mentors or the people in the open *#team-apprentice* chat to help you.
* **Getting stuck is normal** - These exercises are intended to confuse you now and again. This happens in the real world all the time. Figuring out how to get past this confusion is part of the challenge.
