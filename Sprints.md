Sprint structure
===============

*team-apprentice* will be organised around two-week agile sprints, beginning and ending on Wednesdays.

Each sprint will contain a mixture of technical project work (delivered via 20% supervised workshops, 80% unsupervised pair/individual working), shadowing and research.

One *large project* will take up nearly half of apprentices' time per sprint, and will last for at least three sprints. *Medium projects* will last two sprints or less, and *small projects* will last less than one sprint.
