Javascript is a fast-changing programming language. It's designed to run inside a web browser, and is frequently used to add interactivity and rich functionality to web pages.

Beginner

* [Codecademy JS course](codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) - a long, but comprehensive course teaching basic programming principles using javascript. No project-based examples.
* [Javascript has already won](https://medium.com/@jonnyasmar/javascript-has-already-won-235b29ed126b) - blog post about the territory JS and node cover nowadays.

Intermediate

Node.js
