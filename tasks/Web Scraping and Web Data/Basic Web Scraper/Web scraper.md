Web Scraper
====================

***ONGOING IN PAIRS***

**Technology:** Any

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Duration**: 4-6 hours

**Relevant concepts**: hmtl parsing/xpaths, schedules, saving data, plotting data

**Prerequisites** Web Scraper Workshop

Goal
----
Produce a script or program which extracts weather data from a site like bbc weather or the met office on a regular basis and displays it.

The script should:
* Pull weather data on multiple cities from a webpage
* Store the data locally
* Set up a schedule to extract data regularly and store it
* Create a display for the weather data over time

Stretch goals
------------

* Define criteria or set a threshold for 
* Compare weather data against the monthly average for each city.
* Compare weather data forecasts against actual temperature recordings. As a further extension, identify an uncertainty threshold around the forecast data based on days from the current date.

Possible approach
---------------
This program can be implemented fully using the terminal and python. Lxml, requests, numpy and pandas are all useful packages for this project.
