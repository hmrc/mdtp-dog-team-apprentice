Random Number Guesser
====================

**Technology:** Any

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Relevant concepts**: Randomness, loops, handling user input

Goal
----
Produce a script or program which lets a user make guesses as to a random number.

The script should:
* Generate a random number between a specified range
* Accept guesses from the user
* Let the user know if they guess correctly
* Provide helpful clues to the user if they guess correctly

Stretch goal
------------

* The user has a limited number of guesses, and will "lose" if they exceed this number.
* Let the user decide if they would like to play again upon a correct guess, or upon running out of guesses.

Possible approach
---------------
This program can be implemented fully using the terminal and python, but a javascript solution could be implemented in the browser, using a simple user interface (perhaps a button, text input field and area for the program to provide text feedback).
